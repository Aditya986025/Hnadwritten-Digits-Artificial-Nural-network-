The Handwritten Digit Recognition project uses an Artificial Neural Network trained on the MNIST dataset to classify digits from 0 to 9. It processes 28x28 pixel images through input, hidden, and output layers using activation functions and backpropagation to achieve high accuracy in digit prediction.
